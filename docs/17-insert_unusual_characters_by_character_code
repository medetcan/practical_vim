* We insert any character by numeric code using <C-v>{numeric_code}
* This is useful where appropiate mapping doesn't exist on keyboard for given character so we can insert them by their numeric code
* To add a character by unicode code point you can use hexadecimal notation preceding it with u
* If you want to find out any numerical representation of the character that under the cursor you can use "ga" command
