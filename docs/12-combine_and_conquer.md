* Many of the vim's power stems from the way that operators and motions can be combined.
* d{motion} you can combine delete operator with motions to edit a file for different kind of purposesfor example you can delete a paragraph with "dap" or you can use "daw" to delete a word
* "dap" -> delete a paragraph
* "daw" -> delete a word
* "dl" -> delete a character
* c -> change operator
* d -> delete operator
* y -> yank operator
* g~ -> swap case
* gu -> make lowercase
* gU -> make uppercase
* > -> shift right
* < -> shift left
* = -> auto indent
* ! -> filter lines through an external program
* gUaw -> make uppercase a word
* guaw -> make lowercase a word 
* Vim's grammar has a rule when an operator called consecutively it acts on the current line for example dd command deletes the line >> command indents the line
