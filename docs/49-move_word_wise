* Vim makes a distinction between words whether or not it has a punctuation
* When you move by a word vim ignores punctuation but when you move by WORD punctuation is considered.
* w -> move forward by one word
* W -> move forward by one WORD
* b -> move backward by one word
* B -> move backward by one WORD
* e -> forward to end of the next word
* ge -> backward to end of previous word
