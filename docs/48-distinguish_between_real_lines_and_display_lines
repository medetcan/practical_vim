* Unlike many text editors, Vim makes a distinction between real lines and display lines!
* Easiest way to tell the difference between real lines and display lines that real lines have line number.
* h,l,j,k keys are operate on real lines. When you need to move around between display lines you should prefix these keys with the "g" command
* gj -> move down by display lines
* gk -> move up by display lines
* gh -> move left by display lines
* gl -> move right by display lines
* ^ -> move cursor to the first non blank character of real line
* g^ -> move cursor to the first non blank character of display line
* $ -> end of real line
* g$ -> end of display line
