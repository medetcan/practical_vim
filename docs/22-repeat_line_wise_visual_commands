* You can execute normal mode commands in visual mode.
* When you use a normal mode command in visual mode and then repeat the same action using the "." command it acts on the same amount of text that selected before
	* for example you select 2 consecutive lines and indented them using ">" command when you use "." command to repeat the same change on another line it will change the indentation for 2 consecutive lines same as before
