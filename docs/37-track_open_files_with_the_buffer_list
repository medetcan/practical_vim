* Buffers are in memory representation of corresponding physical files. Every change you make happens on buffers
* :ls command gives us a listing of all available buffers that have been loaded into memory
* :bnext command switches us to next buffer in the list
* :bprevious command switches us to previous buffer in the list 
* You can switch between previous and current buffer using <C-^> || <C-6>
* Use :bfirst for accessing to first loaded buffer and :blast for accessing to last loaded buffer
* Numbers are assigned to each buffer we can select a buffer by a number :b {number}
* We can also choose a buffer combining :buffer command with a name. Name should uniquely match one of the buffer's file path 
* The :bufdo command allows us to execute an Ex command in all of the buffers listed by :ls 
* We can delete a buffer using :bdelete command this does not delete original content.
